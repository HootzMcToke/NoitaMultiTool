** I've now added menus for each page, aswell as the ability to backup 3 saves **

** Saves for the steam version of Noita are located in %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Nolla_Games_Noita

** Note - This is setup for steam, you can change "start steam://rungameid/881100" to whatever you're shortcut is ** 

** Note - Make sure you have OEM-US character set is enabled in editor such as Notepad++(encoding>Character sets>Western European>OEM-US) **

** Note - It appears if you have cloud saving on it can sometime cause issues as it tries to upload the save right when you quit so relaunching before that is complete will cause delay, i personally disabled mine **

** If you delete all the saves you will have to go through the intro again, i think i know how to fix that **
