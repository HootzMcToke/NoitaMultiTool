# Noita batch based save tool
### A simple save tool built for Windows by [HootzMcToke](https://steamcommunity.com/id/HootzMcToke)

Saves for Noita are located in %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Nolla_Games_Noita

** Note - This is setup for steam, you can change "start steam://rungameid/881100" to whatever you're shortcut is ** 

** Note - Make sure you have OEM-US character set is enabled in editor such as Notepad++(encoding>Character sets>Western European>OEM-US) **

** Note - This backs up a single save for now ill probably modify it to allow for a few, i just need to find the time since the long weekend is over. **

** Note - It appears if you have cloud saving on it can sometime cause issues as it tries to upload the save right when you quit so relaunching before that is complete will cause delay, i personally disabled mine **
