# HootzMcToke Presents: Noita Save Game Tool

### Now with 3 times the saving!

#### A simple windows based save tool built for Windows by [HootzMcToke](https://steamcommunity.com/id/HootzMcToke)

##### [Download Current Version](https://github.com/HootzMcToke/NoitaSaveTool/releases)

##### *Note - if you plan on making changes to the script, make sure you have OEM-US character set is enabled in editor such as Notepad++(encoding>Character sets>Western European>OEM-US)*

##### This tool is for windows and is currently configured for the steam version of Noita, if you have a non-steam version you can see the notes below.

##### Saves for Noita are located in %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Nolla_Games_Noita

##### Please Note - This is setup for steam, you can change "start steam://rungameid/881100" to whatever you're shortcut is ** 

##### Note - It appears if you have cloud saving on it can sometime cause issues as it tries to upload the save right when you quit so relaunching before that is complete will cause delay, i personally disabled mine **

##### This readme will be removed and replaced by one that is built into the precompiled tool once i reach that stage

##### Check out the github project page to see what features ill be adding in the future
