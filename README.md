Back when Noita launched i really wanted a means of saving and reloading on death, from that idea i created a simple batch script to allow me to backup and restore a single save.

The current version has 3 save slots, and the ability to delete saves and open up the save folder

Upcoming versions will have the ability to start the game with a custom seed, ideally it will undo the change on exit so it only uses a custom seed when you want it to.

The tool is not finished, and it currently only works with the windows / steam version

** If you edit the batch, make sure you have OEM-US character set is enabled in editor such as Notepad++(encoding>Character sets>Western European>OEM-US) **

** Note - has 3 save slots, you can easily add more by editing the :REST and :R00X blocks **

** Note - It appears if you have cloud saving on it can sometime cause issues as it tries to upload the save right when you quit so relaunching before that is complete will cause delay, i personally disabled mine **
