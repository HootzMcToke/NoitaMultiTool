Back when Noita launched i really wanted a means of saving and reloading on death, from that idea i created a simple batch script to allow me to backup and restore a single save.

Features of this version:

- General game launcher
- Backup and restore upto 3 saves (Including in tool deletion)
- Launch Noita with a custom seed
- Quick access to save and install locations

The main goal of this project has been achived, there may be future addtions to the script but nothing planned yet.

** If you edit the batch, make sure you have OEM-US character set is enabled in editor such as Notepad++(encoding>Character sets>Western European>OEM-US) **

** Note - has 3 save slots, but more can be added if you understand what needs to be changed/added

** Note - It appears if you have cloud saving on it can sometime cause issues as it tries to upload the save right when you quit so relaunching before that is complete will cause delay, i personally disabled mine **
